#SpotArtify

This application allows the user to play their Spotify playlists while matching album artwork with the current track.

Uses [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) to retrieve user, playlist, and track data, and the Spotify [SDK beta](https://beta.developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk/) to play and manipulate music.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
